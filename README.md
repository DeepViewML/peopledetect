# ModelPack - People Detection

This project provides the ModelPack People Detection model used by the VisionPack [People Detect UI][peopledetectui] example application.  The model can also be used with other generic VisionPack detection applications such as [detectimg][detectimg] or the GStreamer plug-ins.

The model is trained on the people subset label from the COCO2017 dataset.
